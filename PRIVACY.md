# Privacy Policy

**ScrollSaber** does not collect, store, transmit, or share any personal data.

## What data does ScrollSaber access?

- **Browser storage (local only):** ScrollSaber saves your preferences (color, hilt style, mode, volume, etc.) using `browser.storage.local`. This data never leaves your browser.
- **No analytics, no tracking, no network requests.** ScrollSaber operates entirely offline. It does not phone home, load remote resources, or communicate with any server.

## Permissions explained

| Permission | Why |
|---|---|
| `storage` | Save your saber preferences locally so they persist between sessions |
| `<all_urls>` (content script) | Inject the custom scrollbar overlay on every page you visit |

## Third-party services

None. ScrollSaber has zero external dependencies and makes zero network requests.
